Placeholder Image Instructions
==============================

To add a placeholder car image:

1. Find or download a car image (JPG, PNG, or GIF format)
2. Name it: placeholder-car.jpg
3. Place it in this directory (assets/images/)
4. Recommended size: 800x600 pixels or similar aspect ratio

The placeholder image will be shown when:
- A car listing doesn't have an uploaded image
- The uploaded image file is missing

You can use any car image as a placeholder, or create a simple graphic
that represents a car.
